#  Remunerate mission 

**Context**

My bank account was hacked by an individual named Specter. He's threatening to use all my bitcoins. If someone can attempt to change my password and save my funds, I'm offering a generous reward of 2.5 ETH and an exclusive contract to work with Militech. 

**What happend :**
Last night, while checking my transactions, I realized that my bank account was compromised. Specter, the mysterious hacker, left clues indicating his intention to empty my Bitcoin wallet. 

I can't just stand by while my savings vanish. That's why I'm reaching out to the security expert community. If someone can thwart Specter's plans by changing my password and recovering my assets, an ETH reward awaits you. Moreover, the success of this mission could open doors to a new professional opportunity at Militech. 

Don't wait; every second counts in this race against time and Specter. Together, we can put an end to this threat and perhaps unveil the identity of this formidable hacker.
